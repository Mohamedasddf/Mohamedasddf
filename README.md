## 💫 About Me
I am an ambitious Backend Developer and a Computer Science student passionate about designing and implementing scalable, secure, and efficient backend systems. With expertise in Python, Django, and PostgreSQL, I specialize in building RESTful APIs, integrating authentication systems such as JWT, and managing databases effectively.

I am committed to continuous learning, staying updated with the latest technologies, and leveraging my problem-solving skills to create innovative solutions. I’m also exploring cybersecurity alongside backend development to enhance application security and expand my technical knowledge.
